### Hi, I’m Oxity
I'm a mediocre Python novice at best, I'm still learning the language and I try to do stuff from time to time.  
Most of what I'll do will be open source because everything I do sucks and does not deserve to be closed source.
## What do I do?
Right now not much, but I want to learn game development and web design.
## How can you reach me?
Through my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/r4BjqPDFjf) or [Email](oxity.productions@gmail.com)
